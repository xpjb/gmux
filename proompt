is there some kind of trait for window manager?

what about the constants goin into xwrapper?

the action system / function pointers or whatever it is etc
external commands can just be a shcommand idc lol, well it was execvp

just putting everything in the right order lol


noticing a bug where its hovering on one thats on a different tag

- launcher
- show errors in ze status bar
- log mode with alt tilde or seomthing
- dwm-spawn-cwd patch equivalent would be goated, ctrl+shift+enter
- or alacritty can, or maybe wezterm can

-----------

hot reload system im v curious about

note to self, spin loop in run maybe not very good!
launcher time
production, yea is anything actually wrong?
summary tool or even just cat and commentin out shit for if its too long etc, or ignore imports etc
or use prelude pattern, less imports anyway

include time and date for right_text, cleaning up bar etc


heyy launcher is pretty good,
it needs a bit of ux maybe and not sure if thats the entire path, not sure where dmenu gets the path from.
I can probably pump dmenu in for any improvements to the filtering process etc
