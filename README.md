# Issues
Focus should also change on mouse moved or click inside window, refer to how dwm does its focus


# Nice To Have
* Maybe a notification for successful screenshot too
* Test wezterm launch same working directory window plz
* Run spin loop.. needs fps limit
* Test performance of launcher caching too
* Getting an error in launcher state would probably cook you
* click to change focus too
* close discord no resize
* I dont think launcher refresh works either
fullscreen doesnt work
random .desktop files show up in launcher lol?
test kills the x session and orphans all the windows and theyre in some other session, cooked
Rules: browser on 5
Discord on 4
even the highlight tag wasnt workin
etc
I think it needs to resize app after it resizes it if that makes sense.
alert tag doesnt work either
scroll the top bar
stiff edges tho no wrapping

any mouse movement or click needs to put focus
