# Issues
* Launcher caching doesnt refresh
* Fullscreen shit is fucked, needs to tell app its new dimensions or something. Plays badly with games. or give them fullscreen, would need a test
* random .desktop files show up in launcher lol?

# Nice To Have
* Wiggle focus
* Maybe a notification for successful screenshot too
* Test wezterm launch same working directory window plz
* Run spin loop.. needs fps limit
* Test performance of launcher caching too
* Getting an error in launcher state would probably cook you
* close discord no resize
* I dont think launcher refresh works either
* fullscreen doesnt work
* test kills the x session and orphans all the windows and theyre in some other session, cooked
