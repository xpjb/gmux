# Issues
* Its not xclipping the screenshot but it is taking it
* Sometimes stack gets cooked switching tabs, probably needs to use XID instead of indexes if its doing it
* Maybe a notification for successful screenshot too
* Test wezterm launch same working directory window plz
* Run spin loop.. needs fps limit
* Test performance of launcher caching too
* parse .desktop files for launcher as well, maybe even filtering the garbo, only .desktop files is feasible ???
* Screenshot commands are fucked up
* Getting an error in launcher state would probably cook you

# XID Replacement
sel_idx in mon
.position calls
